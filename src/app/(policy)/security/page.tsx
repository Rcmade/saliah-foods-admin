          How we use your Data and why
        </h3>
        <p>
          We like to get to know our Customers and provide them with the best
          possible experience. We use information we collect about you in a
          number of ways, including to provide the products and services that
          you have requested, offering you a personalised experience and
          informing you about our special events and exciting news, so that we
          can offer the best possible experience. We will also contact you to
          give you assurance that your delivery is on its way or if we have a
          query about your delivery.
        </p>
        <p>
          You will receive marketing messages from us if you have requested
          information from us or purchased products or services from us and, in
          each case, you have not opted out of receiving that marketing. We may
          also market to you if we have received your express consent to do so
          including where we have collected your details in connection with a
          competition or other promotion and you have agreed to receive
          marketing from us.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can stop receiving marketing messages from us at any time. Once
          you do this, we will update your profile to ensure that you don’t
          receive further marketing messages. Note that stopping marketing
          messages will not prevent us from sending you service communications;
          so you will still receive order updates and delivery information.
        </p>
        <p>
          We do not use your personal data for activities where our interests
          are overridden by the impact on you (unless we have your consent or
          are otherwise required or permitted to by law). Your data is also
          anonymised and then used to optimise Saliah Foods International
          systems and procedures.
